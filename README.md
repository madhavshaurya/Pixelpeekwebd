Pixelpeek is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and improving the comfort and productivity of occupants in a room or workspace. It is a web-based application that utilizes a combination of sensors and software to accurately detect the number of people in the room, monitor their posture, and adjust the lighting and temperature as needed to create a comfortable and healthy environment.

Features:

Occupancy detection with real-time data and historical data analysis.
Bad posture detection using machine learning algorithms to detect yawning, nodding, and head tilt parameters.
Light and temperature control using a DHT11 sensor for temperature detection and four LEDs controlled by GPIO pins for lighting control.
User-friendly interface that displays the current occupancy level, temperature, lighting settings, and bad posture detection parameters.
